  1. This to ensure that different versions of python don't
     conflict with eachother.

  2. You can install packages specific to your project.

  3. Also ensures that no changes detrimental changes are 
     made on the computer which might break it.

     This is because when a command is run and a path is not
     found the os searches for multiple paths and makes changes 
     with the path it finds. So if in a virtual enviroment 
     the change made will only stay in the Venv, so safe.
  this is how to install and set up it up.
